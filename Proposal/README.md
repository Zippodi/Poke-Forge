Poke-Forge: A Pokemon Team Builder
Project Proposal

Pokemon is the highest grossing game franchise in history and with an enormous player base. These players battle using the extensive roster of 1021 Pokemon each boasting unique interactions, statistics, and abilities. With the endless combinations for any situation, a player would really benefit from having a place to mock-up, save, and edit teams for their battles. On top of this, gaming consoles have been moving towards a much more portable model, such as the Nintendo Switch. People play anywhere they can get a WiFi signal. There is a need for players to be able to interact with a saved database of their own carefully formed teams on the go. Thus, a PWA would be a perfect solution to this problem. The mobile compatibility would be able to keep up with the console portability, and be usable from any device.
The PWA’s features would include:
Login/Logout: The PWA will have a login and logout system to allow for players to save their teams to a profile. Profiles may be customizable to allow for a more social aspect to the PWA, including sharing teams with friends.
Create/Save Teams: The creating and saving of teams would be the main attraction of the PWA, allowing users to select from a collection of Pokemon with the ability to search based on various attributes and filters. Teams can then be saved and labeled to be retrieved and viewed at any point later. 
Edit/Delete Teams: Users will be able to edit and delete any created team at any time. New Pokemon change effective strategies at all times so the ability to simply edit a team is beneficial. Pressing the edit team button simply takes the user back to the create team page with filled in values for the teams the user has already made. Delete team removes the team from the list of viewed teams.
Sharing Teams: Teams made can be broken down and represented by a X-digit code that can be sent to a friend. This code could then be entered into an option in the PWA and load the same team to be saved and viewed by the friend.
Public Teams: A user can decide to publish a team to be viewed by other users. Users will be able to save any published team, with the ability to search by common Pokemon, types, statistics, or moves.
 
Data Needed: At a minimum, we need the names of Pokemon and some other data about them such as their type and base stat total so players can evaluate how well they will fit into their team.  There are large text files publicly available that have been made by Pokemon fans that contain all of this data and more. These files are mostly used for fans to create their own Pokemon fan games, but will provide us with useful information for our PWA. Pictures of the Pokemon would also be helpful to make the PWA look better, and are available from a wide variety of places on the internet. To maintain stylistic consistency between Pokemon that came out at different times, a resource such as Spriters Resource could be used to get similar-style pictures of Pokemon from one of the more recent games. 



Team Member Contributions: 
Matt W - mdwelker: Created the wireframe for Create New Team and contributed to the Project Proposal, wrote the “data needed” portion of the proposal. Also came up with the core idea of the website.

Dean BenMoshe - dbenmos: Created the Project Proposal and most of its contents. Created the title of the website.

Casey Dockery - cbdocke2: Created the wireframes for the Home Page, View Other Teams pages, and edit/remove team page. Added to the proposal document the links to the images and fonts as well as the information about viewing/editing teams. Since I am pursuing a Graphic Communications minor, I will be doing a lot of the styling.
